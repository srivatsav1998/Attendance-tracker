# Slac
Slac is an abbreviated form of the phrase "Stay Late and Code." This is a group of people who stay later after work hours. They code, learn, and complete projects. This website is designed with the purpose of tracking how many hours a person is working. Slac has been made in such a way that a particular person can login only if they are in the prescribed premises (i.e within the working area or office). There is a single admin account which has all the powers to approve/disapprove a newly signed up member. The user can login only with the unique id, which can be changed only with the admin account. The admin account also has the power to remove an existing member.
