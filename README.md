# Slac
Slac is an abbreviated form of the Stay late and code. This is a group of people who stay later after their work hours. They code, learn and complete projects. This website is designed mainly with the purpose of getting track of number of hours a person is working. We the group members have made it in such a way that a particular person can login only if he is in the prescribed premises (i.e within the working area or office). We have a single admin account which has all the powers to approve/disapprove a newly signed up member. The user can login only with the unique id, which can be changed only with the admin account. The admin account also has the power to even remove an existing member.
