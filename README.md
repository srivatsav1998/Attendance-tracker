# Attendance-Tracker
The primary objective of this solution is to keep track of the student's no of working hours. We the group members have made it in such a way that a particular person can login only if he is in the prescribed premises (i.e within the working area or office). We have a single admin account which has all the powers to approve/disapprove a newly signed up member. The user can login only with the unique id, which can be changed only by the admin account. The admin account also has the power to even remove an existing member.
